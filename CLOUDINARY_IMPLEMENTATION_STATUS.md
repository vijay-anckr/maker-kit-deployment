   ↓
3. Upload to Cloudinary
   ↓
4. Get secure URL
   ↓
5. Pass URL to OpenAI (not base64!)
   ↓
6. OpenAI fetches from Cloudinary CDN

8. Client displays with Cloudinary URL
```

### PDF Upload Flow
```
1. User uploads PDF (client base64)
   ↓
2. API receives base64
   ↓
3. Upload to Cloudinary (as 'raw')

### Optional Enhancements
```typescript
// 1. Signed URLs for private access
const signedUrl = cloudinary.url(publicId, {
  type: 'authenticated',
  sign_url: true,
});

// 2. Upload restrictions
const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(file, {
  allowed_formats: ['jpg', 'png'],
  max_file_size: 10485760, // 10MB
});
```

## 🗑️ File Management

### View Files
1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Click **Media Library**
3. Navigate to `chat-images` or `chat-pdfs`
4. See all uploaded files organized by session

### Delete Files
```typescript
import { deleteFromCloudinary } from './_lib/cloudinary-storage';

// Delete image
await deleteFromCloudinary('chat-images/session_abc_image-0', 'image');

// Delete PDF
await deleteFromCloudinary('chat-pdfs/session_abc_report', 'raw');
```

### Auto-Cleanup (Recommended)
Set up a cron job to delete files older than 7 days:
